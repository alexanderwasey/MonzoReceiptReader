The API is going to use the **Monzo API**, **Azure Vision API**, building and integrating everything in **Python**. 
The goal is to take pictures of a receipt and run it through Microsoft Azure's Vision API to get a raw text dump file. We then take the raw text dump and try to analyze it line by line to see how it's structured and find patterns to how the receipt works. We then extract each item (quantities, singular item prices, total item prices) and feed it into the Monzo API.

Hopefully we'll have enough time.
